      <description>Hello!
I’m Matthew Hoyle.

Aside from my studies, I am also currently a course assistant for STAT 200: Statistical Analysis as well as a social media data analyst intern for the University of Illinois Student Money Management Center. Within my position at the Student Money Management Center, I have gained valuable experience cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as creating automation programs for said processes.</description>
